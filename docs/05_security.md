# Security Best Practices

## Authentication & Authorization
HealthPro API uses JWT-based authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for securing endpoints.

### JWT Authentication
- Access tokens are issued upon successful login and must be included in the `Authorization` header.
- Refresh tokens are used to generate new access tokens without requiring re-authentication.
- Tokens have expiration times to enhance security.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Users can have roles like `admin`, `doctor`, or `patient`.
- Certain endpoints are restricted based on user roles.
- `Depends(is_admin)` is used to enforce role-based access.

## Password Security
- Passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt** before storing them in the database.
- Minimum password length of 8 characters is enforced.
- Password reset tokens are sent via email and expire after a set duration.

## Email Verification
- Users must verify their email before completing the signup process.
- A verification link is sent to the userâ€™s email with a time-limited token.

## API Security Measures
- **CORS Protection**: Configured to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.
- **Rate Limiting**: Can be implemented to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: SQLAlchemy ORM is used to prevent direct SQL injection attacks.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Failed login attempts and suspicious activities are logged.

## Secure API Communication
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all requests are made over HTTPS.
- **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers like `Strict-Transport-Security` and `Content-Security-Policy`.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information such as database credentials and API keys are stored in `.env`.

## Data Privacy & Compliance
- Adheres to GDPR & HIPAA guidelines for handling personal and health-related data.
- Ensures proper encryption for sensitive information.

## Security Updates
- Regular updates of dependencies using:
  ```sh
  pip list --outdated
  pip install --upgrade <package>
  ```

- Security patches are reviewed and applied promptly.

By following these security best practices, HealthPro API ensures a robust and secure platform for users.
