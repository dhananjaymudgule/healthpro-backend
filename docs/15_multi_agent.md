### **📌 Enhancing Your HealthPro Chatbot**  
You want your chatbot to:  
✅ **Answer general health-related questions**  
✅ **Collect and store patient health information (already working)**  
✅ **(Future) Use RAG to answer medical record-related queries**  

---

## **🚀 Do You Need Multiple AI Agents?**  
Yes! Since you have different **task types**, using **multiple AI agents** will make your system modular, scalable, and more efficient.  

### **🔹 Suggested AI Agent Architecture**
| **Agent**  | **Purpose**  | **Example Task**  |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Health QA Agent**  | Answers general health-related questions.  | "What are the symptoms of diabetes?" |
| **Data Collection Agent**  | Collects and stores patient health information. | "What’s your height and weight?" |
| **(Future) RAG Agent**  | Retrieves patient-specific answers from medical records (lab reports, prescriptions, etc.). | "What were my cholesterol levels in my last test?" |

Each agent will have **its own prompt, tools, and logic** but will be **wrapped inside `ChatService`** (as you already planned earlier).

---

## **🛠 Do You Need Multiple Tools?**  
Yes! Since different tasks require different functionalities, using **multiple tools** will help manage them efficiently.  

### **🔹 Suggested Tools**
| **Tool**  | **Purpose**  | **Used By**  |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **store_patient_info**  | Stores collected patient details in the database. | Data Collection Agent |
| **search_health_info**  | Uses an external API (or internal knowledge base) to fetch health-related answers. | Health QA Agent |
| **(Future) retrieve_medical_records**  | Retrieves patient-specific info from vector DB (RAG-based). | RAG Agent |

These tools will be **added dynamically** to the corresponding agents.

## **🔧 Implementation Plan**
### **✅ Short-Term:**
1️⃣ **Modify ChatService** to support **multiple AI agents** based on the query type.  
2️⃣ **Create `HealthQAAgent`** → Use **LLM** + **search_health_info tool**.  
3️⃣ **Keep `DataCollectionAgent` as is** (since it's already working).  

### **🚀 Future (RAG-Based Medical Queries):**
🔹 **Create `RAGAgent`** → Uses **VectorDB** + **retrieve_medical_records tool**.  
🔹 **Embed & index medical records** in **VectorDB** (like **FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate**).  
🔹 **Route patient queries** (LLM decides whether to use `RAGAgent` or `HealthQAAgent`).  

---

## **📌 Next Steps**
**1️⃣ Modify `ChatService`** to route messages to the correct agent.  
**2️⃣ Implement `HealthQAAgent`** (LLM-powered health Q&A).  
**3️⃣ Ensure `store_patient_info` works seamlessly.  
**4️⃣ (Future) Set up RAG for personalized responses.

### **🔥 Summary**
✅ **Multiple AI Agents** → Each specialized for a task.  
✅ **Multiple Tools** → Used as per agent requirements.  
✅ **RAG Integration (Future)** → To fetch patient-specific answers.
