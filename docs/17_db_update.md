### To track when patient information was last modified. This will help you:

âœ… Monitor updates: Know when the patient's details were last changed.
âœ… Improve chatbot responses: If a user updates their health info, you can acknowledge the change.
âœ… Optimize data validation: If info hasnâ€™t been updated for a long time, you might prompt the user to confirm if itâ€™s still accurate.

------------------------------------------------

Yes, you should add a timestamp column (created_at and last_updated) in the users table.

ðŸ”¹ Why?

Track user sign-up dates (created_at).

Monitor profile updates (last_updated).

Improve security (e.g., flag inactive users based on last_updated).

Audit log purposes (when did the user join? when was their profile last changed?).

-----------------------------------------------

 Why add created_at and last_updated?

Helps track sign-up dates.

Monitors profile updates.

Supports audit logs and security checks.




---------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Why Add created_at in the patients Table?
âœ… Track when the patient record was created (useful for analytics and monitoring).
âœ… Differentiate between old vs. newly added patients (e.g., show "New Patient" tags in reports).
âœ… Useful for audits & compliance (e.g., track when health data was first stored).
âœ… Consistency â€“ Your users table already has created_at, so adding it to patients keeps things structured.
